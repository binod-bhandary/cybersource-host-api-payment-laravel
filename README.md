 ### Hosted Checkout Example (JavaScript)
```
<!-- Your payment form in HTML -->
<form action="https://secureacceptance.cybersource.com/pay" method="POST" id="cybersource-payment-form">
    <!-- Add necessary input fields here (e.g., amount, currency, merchant ID, etc.) -->
    <input type="hidden" name="access_key" value="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY">
    <input type="hidden" name="profile_id" value="YOUR_PROFILE_ID">
    <!-- Add other required fields -->

    <input type="submit" value="Pay Now">
</form>

<!-- JavaScript to submit the form on page load -->
<script>
    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
        document.getElementById("cybersource-payment-form").submit();
    });
</script>

```
### API Checkout Example (Python - Using Requests library):
```
import requests

# Set your Cybersource credentials and API endpoint
merchant_id = "YOUR_MERCHANT_ID"
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
api_endpoint = "https://api.cybersource.com/payments/v1/authorizations"

# Payment data
payment_data = {
    "amount": "100.00",
    "currency": "USD",
    "payment_method": {
        "card": {
            "number": "4111111111111111",
            "expiration_month": "12",
            "expiration_year": "2024",
            "cvv": "123",
        }
    },
    # Add other required data for the transaction
}

# API call to Cybersource
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
}

try:
    response = requests.post(api_endpoint, json=payment_data, headers=headers)
    response_data = response.json()
    # Process the response data here (e.g., check for success, handle errors, etc.)
    print(response_data)
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    # Handle connection or request-related errors
    print("Error: ", e)

```
